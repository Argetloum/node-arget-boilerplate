Node Arget Boilerplate
=======================
Custom Boilerplate for node.js inspired by node-boilerplate
Regardless to Node Boilerplate, we use the same dependencies, but adding some libs usefull in every projects !


**Dependencies :**
  - connect
  - express
  - jade
  - mongoose
  - socket.io

**And some usefull libs :**
  - grunt.js
  - less css
  - lesshat.less

##Start a project

####1. Clone the repository and execute the shell

		git clone https://github.com/Argetloum/node-arget-boilerplate.git mynewproject
		cd mynewproject
		./initproject.sh

This will copy down all of the boilerplate files, organize them appropriately and init a fresh new git repository within which you can build your next big thing.

####2. Do npm install to install the dependencies

    		sudo npm install

####3. Run the boilerplate template app:

		node server.js
